	  <h1>Recommendations</h1>
	  <p>I can honestly say that Taherul is an excellent person and a joy to work with. He has a keen thirst for knowledge and is always willing to put himself forward for a challenging task, which he seems to effortlessly take in his stride. With these personal traits in mind, he has built a formidable understanding of the mobile platform that he is always willing to share. He has taken a real ownership of the manual and automated testing of the iPhone and Android applications, driving it forward with care and an amazing attention to detail.</p>
	  <p>Steven Bone, <i>Test Analyst</i>, <b>AIMIA</b></p>
	  <br></br>
	<p>Taherul has established himself as a senior test analyst and a specialist in the still immature field of automated testing of mobile apps. With great attention to detail, an enthusiasm for the field, loads of experience working in Agile teams and with mixed offshore/onshore teams, I would certainly recommend Taherul and look forward to working with him again in the future.</p>
	<p>Chris Thomas, <b>Technical Architect</b></p>
	<br></br>
	<p>I directly managed and mentored Taherul for several years and I very quickly developed a great respect and admiration for him and the qualities he embodies. He is motivated, self-driven, and very smart, and he rapidly absorbs and understands issues. Taherul's fascination with technology and his potent thirst for knowledge lead him to finding creative solutions, and he always focuses upon delivering the best value possible for users and stakeholders alike. 
Taherul is very much a team player and readily forms authentic and positive working partnerships across the business. On a personal level he displays enormous integrity and dedication, and he is one of the most genuine and affable colleagues I have ever had the pleasure of working with. I happily and wholeheartedly recommend Taherul as a test professional and test automation specialist and I sincerely hope there may come an opportunity to work with him again in the future.</p>
<p>Quentin Walker, <i>QA Lead</i>, <b>Sony Computer Entertainment Europe</b></p>
<br></br>
<p>Taherul is not afraid to take on challenges that place him outside of his comfort zone, in fact it is something he relishes. At Aimia he took ownership of the iOS test automation suite learning several new tools and technologies in the process. He took a proactive approach to solving problems which made mentoring him during his learning of Javascript, XCode and Instruments a pleasure.</p>
